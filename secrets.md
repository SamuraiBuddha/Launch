# Configuration Management

## Overview
This document outlines secure configuration practices for the MAGI Infrastructure Launch Dashboard.

## Environment Variables
All sensitive configuration should be stored in environment variables:
- Database connection strings
- API authentication tokens  
- Service access keys
- Encryption keys

## Setup Instructions
1. Copy `.env.template` to `.env`
2. Fill in your specific configuration values
3. Never commit the `.env` file to version control
4. Use strong, unique values for all credentials

## Required Configuration
- PostgreSQL database connection
- Redis cache configuration
- Qdrant vector database setup
- LM Studio API access
- ComfyUI service connection
- GitHub token for MCP integration

## Security Guidelines
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Use minimum required permissions
- Monitor access logs
- Encrypt data in transit and at rest

## Tools
- Use password managers for credential storage
- Implement automatic rotation where possible
- Set up monitoring for authentication failures
- Regular security audits

# Security Policy

## 🛡️ Security Overview

The Launch MAGI Infrastructure Dashboard is designed with security as a core principle. This document outlines our security policies and procedures for reporting vulnerabilities.

## 🔒 Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| 1.x.x   | ✅ |

## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

### Reporting Process

1. **Email**: Send details to the repository maintainer via GitHub
2. **Include**: 
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Status Update**: Weekly updates on progress
- **Resolution**: Target 30 days for critical issues

## 🔐 Security Measures

### Infrastructure Security
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- No hardcoded credentials in source code
- Comprehensive `.gitignore` protection
- Secure MCP server configurations

### Access Control
- Service-specific ports and authentication
- Health check endpoints without credential exposure
- Isolated launch groups for different service categories

### Data Protection
- Local-first architecture (no external data transmission)
- Encrypted connections for service communication
- Secure file handling and storage

## ⚠️ Security Guidelines

### For Contributors
1. **Never commit** sensitive information (API keys, passwords, tokens)
2. **Use environment variables** for configuration
3. **Test security** before submitting PRs
4. **Follow** secure coding practices

### For Users
1. **Review configurations** before deployment
2. **Use strong passwords** for database connections
3. **Regularly update** dependencies
4. **Monitor** system logs for suspicious activity

## 🔧 Security Tools & Dependencies

### Automated Security
- Git hooks for credential scanning
- Dependency vulnerability checking
- Configuration validation

### Security Dependencies
- PostgreSQL with authentication
- Redis with access controls
- Secure MCP protocol implementation

## 📋 Security Checklist

Before deploying:
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Database credentials secured
- [ ] Network access properly restricted
